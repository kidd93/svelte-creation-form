# Svelte-Creation-Form

## Description
    Svelte-Creation-Form is a user creation form bulit with Svelte. Users can sign up and then login into their profile. Svlete-Creation-Form was also built using userbase which gives each user their own Id. Once users sign up they are logged into their profile. Currently every users profile will have a contact form asking them to comment on their experience with creating an account. Whether or not the contact form is filled out each user has the capability of logging out which will then lead them to the login page.
